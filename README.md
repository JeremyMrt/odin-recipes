# odin-recipes

<p>The first project with TOP for a basic cookbook.</p>

<p>I had a lot of fun doing it. I might have overdone it using a bit of flexbox. I tried to place the image in the ingredients part using float: right but it wouldn't fit inside the borders.</p>

<p>I am  really looking forward to make it responsive ! And I might come back at the end of Foundations to check how I could make my CSS code better and more efficient </p>

<p> Enjoy your french meal :) </p>
