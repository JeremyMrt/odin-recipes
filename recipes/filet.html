    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Sometimes, cream sauce takes a simple dish to a new level.</p>

        <p>Associated with pepper, heaven isn't that far away.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>For 4 servings</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup coarsely crushed black peppercorns</li>
            <li>4 (6 ounce) 1 1/2 inch thick filet mignon steaks</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>

            <dt>Step 1</dt>
            <dd>Place the peppercorns into a shallow bowl. Sprinkle the beef tenderloin filets with salt on both sides, and coat both sides with crushed peppercorns.</dd>
            <dt>Step 2</dt>
            <dd>Melt the butter with the olive oil over high heat in a heavy skillet (not nonstick) until the foam disappears from the butter. Gently place the steaks in the pan, and cook until they start to become firm and are reddish-pink and juicy in the center, about 3 1/2 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Remove the steaks to platter, and cover tightly with foil.</dd>
            <dt>Step 3</dt>
            <dd>Pour the beef broth into the skillet, and use a whisk to stir the broth and scrape up any dissolved brown flavor bits from the skillet. Whisk in the cream, and simmer the sauce until it's reduced and thickened, 6 to 7 minutes. Place the steaks back in the skillet, turn to coat with sauce, and serve with the remaining sauce.</dd>
